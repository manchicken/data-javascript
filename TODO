ECMAScript and charset support for hjsdump

Encoding, escape [^[:print:]]
	Doesn't seem to include Unicode in 5.8.4...

Numbers
	Infinity

	NaN

	const (check attribute?)

Lightweight (object initializer) output for 1.2+
	JavaScript 1.2 and later support a compact object notation known
	as object literals. We probably want to walk depth first if using
	this notation.

	HASH = {key:val}
	ARRAY= [0, 1, 2]

	See nuclear wessels, wait for Anon/Lite merger because it requires
	inline dumping

More robust var naming (get & use perl names?)

Unify:
	How to scan & determine which format is best?
	constructor, flat, literal, class/prototype

	Data::JavaScript
	Data::JavaScript::LiteObject
		allow objects to be stuffed into an array and use the key names
		as var names? to what end, would have to know var names

	Data::JavaScript::Anon		(Perl : anonymous :: JS : literal)
		jsdump takes undef as name

		worries too much about valid numbers but not strings,
		validation belongs elsewhere

	Template::Plugin::JavaScript
		__quotemeta

	JSON
		why oh why
		    is it a top-level name?
		    didn't he look around first?

	XML feed, Atom feed?
